        summary="Potential Multiple Certificate Exploit"
        explanation="Improper validation of app signatures could lead to issues where a malicious app submits itself to the Play Store with both its real certificate and a fake certificate and gains access to functionality or information it shouldn&apos;t have due to another application only checking for the fake certificate and ignoring the rest. Please make sure to validate all signatures returned by this method."
